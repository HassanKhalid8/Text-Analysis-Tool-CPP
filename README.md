# Text Analysis Tool (C++)

[cite_start]A robust console-based application developed as a Fundamentals of C++ project at the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology[cite: 1, 4]. [cite_start]This tool performs comprehensive linguistic analysis on user-provided text paragraphs to extract helpful insights[cite: 12, 14].

## 🚀 Features
- [cite_start]**Paragraph Merging:** Combine two distinct text inputs into a single string for unified analysis[cite: 13, 26, 39].
- [cite_start]**Vowel Counting:** Calculate total vowel counts for individual or merged paragraphs[cite: 13, 26, 40].
- [cite_start]**Word Tracking:** Locate both the first and all subsequent occurrences of a specific word or phrase[cite: 13, 26, 41, 42].
- [cite_start]**Visual Histograms:** Generate word-frequency histograms in alphabetical or increasing frequency order using C++ Maps[cite: 13, 26, 43, 44].
- [cite_start]**Text Reversal:** Reverse the characters of every word within a selected paragraph[cite: 13, 26, 45].

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- [cite_start]**Language:** C++ [cite: 12, 17]
- [cite_start]**Interface:** Console-based menu system [cite: 18, 25, 38]
- [cite_start]**Libraries Used:** `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<sstream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<map>`[cite: 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
- [cite_start]**Architecture:** Modular design with distinct functions for specific analysis tasks[cite: 25].

## 📊 Documentation
[cite_start]Detailed information regarding the system methodology, logic flowchart, and sample user interface is available in the [Text Analyzer.pdf](docs/Text%20Analyzer.pdf)[cite: 7, 16, 33, 34].

## 💻 Usage
1. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o TextAnalyzer`).
2. Run the executable.
3. [cite_start]Input two paragraphs and a target search word when prompted[cite: 34, 35, 37].
4. [cite_start]Select an analysis option from the interactive menu (1-8)[cite: 37, 38, 46].
