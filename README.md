# Text Analysis Tool (C++)

A robust console-based application developed as a Fundamentals of C++ project at the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology. This tool performs comprehensive linguistic analysis on user-provided text paragraphs to extract helpful insights.

## 🚀 Features
- **Paragraph Merging:** Combine two distinct text inputs into a single string for unified analysis.
- **Vowel Counting:** Calculate total vowel counts for individual or merged paragraphs.
- **Word Tracking:** Locate both the first and all subsequent occurrences of a specific word.
- **Visual Histograms:** Generate word-frequency histograms in alphabetical or frequency order.
- **Text Reversal:** Reverse the characters of every word within a selected paragraph.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Language:** C++
- **Interface:** Console-based menu system
- **Libraries:** `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<sstream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<map>`.
- **Architecture:** Modular design with distinct functions for specific analysis tasks.

## 📊 Documentation

## 💻 Usage
1. Compile the `main.cpp` file (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o TextAnalyzer`).
2. Run the executable.
3. Input two paragraphs and a target search word when prompted.
4. Select an analysis option from the interactive menu (1-8).
